            “We are so happy with the wedding video we received from Be Joined Films. Jared was so easy to work with, a wedding videographer who really created a unique recount of our wedding day capturing the parts we loved the most. The way he wove our vows within the film really represented us as a couple, it will be just as magical to watch in the years to come as a family.”
