            “We are so happy with the wedding video we received from Be Joined
            Films. Jared was so easy to work with, a wedding videographer who
            really created a unique recount of our wedding day capturing the
            parts we loved the most. The way he wove our vows within the film
            really represented us as a couple, it will be just as magical to
            watch in the years to come as a family.”
