        text:"Hayley + Simon sure know how to put on a show stopping day, hiring Parihoa Farm on the clifftops of Auckland’s west coast, they treated family and friends to a day celebrating epic love. Hayley owner of H&Co hair salon surprised Simon with a new haircut on their big day. Simon a little nervous (as all grooms are) didn’t know where to look when his bride walked down the aisle with a new-do amongst expert wedding styling from our friends at Flock Events. The unique black arch pairing perfectly with Hayleys J’Adior Slingbacks’s, Diamond Store ring set and minimalist cake from K Cakes. As always we loved shooting with Jody from I Do Photography, the best formula of epic people + epic location = epic film. Thank you for allowing us to capture your love Hayley and Simon and be apart of your day. ",
